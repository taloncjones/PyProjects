# FirstMLProject

The purpose of this project is to gain exposure to Machine Learning. The project will follow the tutorial found [here](https://elitedatascience.com/python-machine-learning-tutorial-scikit-learn)

This project uses a number of different metrics for red wine to predict the red wine's score. Ex:
```
fixed acidity   volatile acidity    citric acid ...     pH      sulphates   alcohol
9.3             0.370               0.44        ...     3.24    0.81        10.8
```
